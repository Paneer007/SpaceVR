Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its rusty appearance. It has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers and features a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars is known for diverse geological features, including the largest volcano and canyon in the solar systemâ€”Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris, respectively. Recent exploration missions have provided insights into Mars' history and potential habitability.

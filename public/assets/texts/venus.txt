Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is similar in size and composition to Earth. It has a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers and a thick, toxic atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide. Venus experiences a runaway greenhouse effect, resulting in surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. It rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets. Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size, but its harsh conditions make it inhospitable for life as we know it.

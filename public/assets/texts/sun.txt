The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. 
It has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers and a mass about 333,000 times that of Earth. 
The Sun's immense gravitational pull keeps the planets in orbit. 
It generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, converting hydrogen into helium, releasing light and heat. 
This radiant energy sustains life on Earth and influences the dynamics of the entire solar system.
